# Geographical Data

### Description
These files contain geographical data that is used by files in various other directories for feature generation.

### Files
  * **all-geocodes-v2017** is the U.S. Census 2017 State, County, Minor Civil Division, and Incorporated Place FIPS Codes file available from [here](https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/2017/demo/popest/2017-fips.html); the original .xlsx file's header was removed and then it was exported to a .csv
  * **ruca2010revised.csv** is the U.S. Department of Agriculture 2010 Rural-Urban Commuting Area Codes (revised 7/3/2019) available from [here](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/rural-urban-commuting-area-codes/) which is primarily used as a source of county land area; the original .xlsx file's header was removed and then it was exported to a .csv
  * **FIPS_used.csv** is a simple .csv of all U.S. counties/county-equivalents we use in our model
  * **pandemic-central-watermark-2.png** and **pandemic-central-watermark-3.png** are images used to add watermarks to our output graphs made by `model/map.py`
  * **gz_2010_us_050_00_20m.topojson** is used to make the map on our [website homepage](https://www.itsonit.com) and is generated by the following process:
    1. Get 20m GeoJSON U.S. Counties file from Eric Celeste's [website](https://eric.clst.org/tech/usgeojson/), which was generated from [U.S. Census Cartographic Boundary Files](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html) for the 2010 census
    2. Convert this file from a GeoJSON format to TopoJSON format using Matthew Bloch's [mapshaper.org](https://mapshaper.org/) with default parameters; the file is simply uploaded (with line intersections detection) and then exported as a TopoJSON file
