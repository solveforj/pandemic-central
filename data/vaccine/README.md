## How to Use
Column Name  |  Meaning
--|--
state  |  name of state in two-letter format
date  |  date of **distribution allocations*** _(not cumulative)_
pfizer_first_doses  |  number of Pfizer doses allocated _(not cumulative)_
moderna_first_doses  |  number of Moderna doses allocated _(not cumulative)_
total_first_doses  |  pfizer_first_doses + moderna_first_doses _(not cumulative)_

## Notice

- 2nd doses of Pfizer are scheduled to be administered 21 days after 1st doses

- 2nd doses of Moderna are scheduled to be administered 28 days after 1st doses

    Source: https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/clinical-considerations.html

- The efficacy of Pfizer is claimed to be ~95% on 28th day after first dose

- Generally for vaccines, longer gap between first and booster doses create a better immune response. However, there has not been enough data about extending such gap with COVID-19 vaccines.

- *Date of distribution allocations are different from dates of administered, which vary by states.

- Again, values not cumulative, doses are new ones on specified dates.
